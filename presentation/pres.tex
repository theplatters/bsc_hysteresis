%% The above lines help editors like TeXstudio to automatically choose the right tools
%% to compile your LaTeX source file. If your tool does not support these magic comments,
%% you will need to make appropriate manual choices.
%%
%% You can safely use "pdflatex" instead of "xelatex" if you prefer the pdfLaTeX toolchain.
%% However, pdfLaTeX will not be able to deliver the professional font experience that you
%% will get with XeLaTeX.
%%
%% _Important_: These magic comments should be on the first lines of your source file.

%% Document class: This is a LaTeX beamer presentation.

\documentclass[utf8,aspectratio=169,ngerman,english]{beamer}

\usetheme[darkmode,fancyfonts,totalframenumber,mathastext.TNF]{jku}

%%
%% Note that `nosectionpage' automatically sets `nosubsectionpage' and `nosubsubsectionpage'.
%% You could still e.g. show only subsubsection pages by using `nosectionpage,subsubsectionpage'.
%%
%% Space-efficient monospace font options (requires XeTeX):
%%  * compactmono   ... Use condensed fixed-width font everywhere.
%%  * nocompactverb ... Do not use condensed fixed-width font for verbatim and listings.
%%
%% Style-breaking options:
%%  * nojkufooter    ... Do not insert JKU/partner logos into the frame footer.
%%  * nofooter       ... Do not display a frame footer.
%%  * noimprint      ... Do not insert imprint on title pages.
%%  * frametitlecaps ... Set frame titles in capital letters (like in eariler theme versions).
%%  * nofancyfonts   ... Do not use custom TTF fonts with XeTeX / supress pdfLaTeX warning.
%%  * mac            ... Use adapted color palette for screen display on Mac.
%%
%% Experimental options:
%%  * mathastext ... Use standard document fonts (and default to sans-serif font) in math mode
%%
%% Advanced options:
%%  * nooptpackages     ... Do not load additional convenience packages (which are only there
%%                          to provide interoperability to the behavior of previous versions of
%%                          this theme but are not actually required for the current version).
%%  * logopath={<path>} ... Set the path where the theme can find its own logo resources. This
%%                          should typically be a relative path and the default is `./logos'.
%%  * fontpath={<path>} ... Set the path where the theme can find its own font resources. This
%%                          should typically be a relative path and the default is `./fonts'.
%%
%% Hint: Boolean options can be used in the forms `option' or `option=true' the enable the
%% option and `nooption' or `option=false' to disable the option.
